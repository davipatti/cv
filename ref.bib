We estimated effectiveness of monovalent COVID‐19 mRNA booster vaccination versus two‐dose primary series during a period of Omicron variant virus circulation in a community cohort with active illness surveillance. Hazard ratios comparing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection between booster versus primary series vaccinated individuals were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models with time‐varying booster status. Models were adjusted for age and prior SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The effectiveness of a second booster among adults ≥50 years of age was similarly estimated. The analysis included 883 participants ranging in age, from 5 to >90 years. Relative effectiveness was 51\% (95\% CI: 34\%, 64\%) favoring the booster compared with primary series vaccination and did not vary by prior infection status. Relative effectiveness was 74\% (95\% CI: 57\%, 84\%) at 15 to 90 days after booster receipt, but declined to 42\% (95\% CI: 16\%, 61\%) after 91 to 180 days, and to 36\% (95\% CI: 3\%, 58\%) after 180 days. The relative effectiveness of a second booster compared to a single booster was 24\% (95\% CI: −40\% to 61\%). An mRNA vaccine booster dose added significant protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, but protection decreased over time. A second booster did not add significant protection for adults ≥50 years of age. Uptake of recommended bivalent boosters should be encouraged to increase protection against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 sublineages.}},

The virus acquired several amino acid substitutions that were responsible for antigenic drift until the 2018–2019 influenza season. Viruses possessing mutations in the NA and PA proteins that cause reduced susceptibility to NA inhibitors and baloxavir marboxil, respectively, have been detected after antiviral treatment, albeit infrequently. Here, we analyzed HA, NA, and PA sequences derived from A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that were isolated during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons in Japan. We found that A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses possessing the D187A and Q189E substitutions in HA emerged and dominated during the 2019–2020 season; these substitutions in the antigenic site Sb, a high potency neutralizing antibody-eliciting site for humans, changed the antigenicity of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Furthermore, we found that isolates possessing the N156K substitution, which was predicted to affect the antigenicity of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus at the laboratory level, were detected at a frequency of 1.0\% in the 2018–2019 season but 10.1\% in the 2019–2020 season. These findings indicate that two kinds of antigenically drifted viruses—N156K and D187A/Q189E viruses—co-circulated during the 2019–2020 influenza season in Japan.}},

  abstract = {{Mutations accumulate in influenza A virus proteins, especially in the main epitopes on the virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA). For influenza A(H3N2) viruses, in particular, the antigenicity of their HA has altered since their emergence in 1968, requiring changes of vaccine strains every few years. Most adults have been exposed to several antigenically divergent H3N2 viruses through infection and/or vaccination, and those exposures affect the immune responses of those individuals. However, animal models reflecting this ‘immune history’ in humans are lacking and naïve animals are generally used for vaccination and virus challenge studies. Here, we describe a ferret model to mimic the serial exposure of humans to antigenically different historical H3HA proteins. In this model, ferrets were sequentially immunized with adjuvanted recombinant H3HA proteins from two or three different H3HA antigenic clusters in chronological order, and serum neutralizing antibody titers were examined against the homologous virus and viruses from different antigenic clusters. For ferrets immunized with a single HA antigen, serum neutralizing antibody titers were elevated specifically against the homologous virus. However, after immunization with the second or third antigenically distinct HA antigen in chronological order, the ferrets showed an increase in more broadly cross-reactive neutralizing titers against the antigenically distinct viruses and against the homologous virus. Sequentially immunized animals challenged with an antigenically advanced H3N2 virus showed attenuated virus growth and less body temperature increase compared with naïve animals. These results suggest that sequential exposure to antigenically different HAs elicits broader neutralizing activity in sera and enhances immune responses against more antigenically distinct viruses Our findings may partly explain why adults who have been exposed to antigenically divergent HAs are less likely to be infected with influenza virus and have severe symptoms than children.}},

Interestingly, we did not detect viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b, which in recent years have dominated in different parts of the world. The viruses isolated in this current study do not encode major determinants of mammalian adaptation (e.g., PB2-E627K or PB1-D701N) but possess amino acid substitutions that may affect viral receptor-binding, replication, or the responses to human antiviral factors. Several of the highly pathogenic H5N6 virus samples contained other influenza viruses, providing an opportunity for reassortment. Collectively, our study demonstrates that the highly pathogenic H5 viruses circulating in Vietnam in 2018–2021 were different from those in other parts of the world, and that the Vietnamese H5 viruses continue to evolve through mutations and reassortment.}},
